Installing svmgraph
===================

svmgraph generates images from a SDS/SVM configuration.

To install the script, simply run the following commands
(where x.xx is the current script version):

    $ tar xvzf svmgraph-x.xx.tar.gz
    $ cd svmgraph-x.xx
    $ perl Makefile.PL

and as root:

    # make install

If you are used to the CPAN way of doing things, the procedure is the
same as always:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    # make install

At your option, you may use the Build system which doesn't require the make(1)
utility:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ perl Build
    $ perl Build test
    $ su
    # perl Build install

This module requires four other modules: Solaris::Disk::SVM,
Solaris::Disk::Partitions and Solaris::Disk::MountTable, and, obviously,
GraphViz.
